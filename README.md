# Scene analysis 

This application captures the video stream from the default system camera and performs primitive shape detection. The detected shapes are superimposed on the video. If the user clicks on a detected shape, a text displaying the shape's type is dislayed at the center of the shape.

Implementation:
* Visual Studio 2010
* OpenCV 2.4.11
